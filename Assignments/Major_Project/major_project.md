# Major Project (40% [10% project selection] + [30% project assessment])

For the major project, you will take a published dataset and complete all the analysis tasks (from raw data to final results) and write up a report. This report must be structured like a small journal article, with abstract (summarising the project), introduction (background on the study and identification of the research hypothesis), methods (analysis steps and programs used), results (what you found) and discusson (how the results relate to the research question) sections. Marks will also be awarded to the bash/R or RMarkdown scripts that you use.

|Section                    |Mark |
|:--------------------------|:----|
|Abstract                   |5%   |
|Introduction + hypothesis  |10%  |
|Methods                    |20%  |
|Results & Discussion       |30%  |
|References                 |5%   |
|Analysis scripts           |30%  |
