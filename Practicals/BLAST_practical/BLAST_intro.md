# Introduction to BLAST

## 1. Background

NCBI BLAST is a suite of programs that will find local alignments of query sequences to database entries. We will use the command line version of BLAST to identify protein coding regions in a human genomic sequence and also to identify repeats (transposons) in the same human sequence.  This will give you an idea of the complexity of alignment based annotation.
