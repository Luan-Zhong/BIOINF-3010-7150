2020-05-26 and 2020-05-29

The two tutorials will be separated into:
1. Data handling (Tuesday 2020-05-26)
2. Population genomics applications (Friday 2020-05-29)



You have previously learnt about different raw or processed high throughput sequencing data formats (e.g., FASTQ, SAM/BAM, VCF).

We are going to start


Create working directory in your home directory
mkdir ~/BIOINF_Tuesday

What is Conda? (from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.

Add the bioconda channel
cd
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
