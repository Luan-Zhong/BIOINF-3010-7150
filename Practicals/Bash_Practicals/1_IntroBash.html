</ul>
<h1 id="introduction-to-bash">Introduction to Bash</h1>
<h2 id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>The practicals that you will be participating in will make use of a computer that is provided by The University as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> (VM).
The VM is essentially a program that is running on a server but which behaves as though it is an individual separate computer.
You will be able to log in to the VM and interact with the programs that it has installed.
The VMs provided each have 2 CPU cores, 8GB of system memory and 80GB of hard disk space.
They are yours to use for the semester, but they are also yours to look after.</p>
<p><strong>Please <a href="../vm_connection">go here</a> for instructions on connecting to your VM.</strong></p>
<h2 id="rstudio">RStudio</h2>
<p>You will be using a program called RStudio to interact with your VM.
Each VM has RStudio Server running on it and serving a web page that you can interact with via a web browser.</p>
<p>When you have connected to the VM, you should see something that looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="images/RStudio.png" alt="RStudio initial login screen"></p>
<p>You will only be using the Terminal part (pane) of the RStudio window; this is the part that you used to reset your password.
You can maximise the Terminal pane with the icon on the top right of that section of the window.</p>
<p>An important step in many analyses is moving data around on a high-performance computer (HPC), and setting jobs running that can take hours, days or even weeks to perform.
For this, we need to learn how to write scripts which perform these actions, and the primary environment for this is <code>bash</code>.</p>
<p>We can utilise <code>bash</code> in two primary ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interactively through the terminal</li>
<li>Through a script which manages various stages of an analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>For most of today we will work interactively, however a complete analysis should be scripted so we have a record of everything we do.
This is often referred to as <em>Reproducible Research</em>, and in reality, our scripts are like an electronic lab book and will help you remember exactly what analyses you have performed.
When you're writing up methods for a report, paper or thesis, referring back to your scripts will be very useful.</p>
<h2 id="running-bash-on-your-vm">Running <code>bash</code> on your VM</h2>
<p>All computers running MacOS and Linux have a terminal built-in as part of the standard setup, whilst for Windows there are several options, including <code>git bash</code> which also enables use of version control for your scripts.
To keep everything consistent for this practical, we'll use the terminal which is available inside <code>RStudio</code>.
Note that even though we're using <code>RStudio</code>, we won't be interacting with <code>R</code> today as <code>R</code> runs interactively in the <code>Console</code>.
Instead we'll be using one of the other features provided by <code>RStudio</code> to access <code>bash</code></p>
<p>To access this, open <code>RStudio</code> and make sure the <code>Console</code> window is visible.
Inside this pane, you will see a <strong>Terminal</strong> Tab so click on this and you will be at an interactive terminal running <code>bash</code>.</p>
<p>We'll explore a few important commands below, and the words <em>shell</em> and <em>bash</em> will often be used interchangeably with the terminal window.</p>
<p>If you've ever heard of the phrase <strong>shell scripts</strong>, this refers to a series of commands like we will learn in these sessions, strung together into a plain text file, and which is then able to be run as a single process.</p>
<p>Although we haven't specifically mentioned this up until now, your virtual machines are running a distribution of Linux, and we can access these machines by logging in remotely, as well as through the <code>RStudio</code> interface.</p>
<h2 id="setup-the-directory-for-today">Setup the directory for today</h2>
<p>First we will set up a directory for today's practical.
In general it is very worthwhile to keep all your project-specific code and data organised into a consistent location and structure.
This is not essential, but is very useful and is good practice.
If you don't follow this step, you will be making your life much harder and will not be following 'best practice' data analysis.
For practicals where R will be used, everything will be harder if you do not follow the equivalent strategy there.</p>
<p>To make and enter the directory that you will be working in, run the following commands in the terminal pane (try to figure out what they mean — we will be going over them more later in the prac).</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>mkdir ~/Project_0
cd ~/Project_0
</div></code></pre>
<p>You will now find yourself in this directory you have created.
If you look at the bottom right pane of your RStudio session you will see <code>Project_0</code> appeared when you executed <code>mkdir ~/Project_0</code>.
If you need to, you can navigate through the directories and select files with the file navigation pane just as you would with a normal file browser.</p>
<p>Making this directory to work in will help you keep everything organised so you can find your work later.
Managing your data and code well is a considerable challenge in bioinformatics.</p>
<h2 id="initial-goals">Initial Goals</h2>
<p>Now we have setup our VM, the basic aims of the following sessions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gain familiarity and confidence within the Linux command-line environment</li>
<li>Learn how to navigate directories, as well as to copy, move and delete the files within them</li>
<li>Look up the name of a command needed to perform a specified task</li>
<li>Get a basic understanding of shell scripting</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="finding-your-way-around">Finding your way around</h2>
<p>Once you're in the <code>Terminal</code> section of <code>RStudio</code>, you will notice some text describing your computer of the form</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>(base) student@bioinf-3010-2022-xx:~/Project_0$
</div></code></pre>
<p>The first section of this describes your username (<code>student</code>) and the machine <code>@bioinf-3010-2022-xx</code>.
The end of the machine identifier is marked with a colon (<code>:</code>).</p>
<p>After the colon, the string (<code>~/Project_0</code>) represents your current directory, whilst the dollar sign (<code>$</code>) indicates the end of this path and the beginning of where you will type commands.
This is the standard interface for the Bourne-again Shell, or <code>bash</code>.</p>
<h3 id="where-are-we">Where are we?</h3>
<h4 id="pwd">pwd</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>Type the command <code>pwd</code> in the terminal then press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key and you will see the output which describes the current directory you are in.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>pwd
</div></code></pre>
<p>The command <code>pwd</code> is what we use to <strong>p</strong>rint the current (i.e. <strong>w</strong>orking) <strong>d</strong>irectory.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>/home/student/Project_0
</div></code></pre>
<p>Check with your neighbour to see if you get the same thing.
If not, see if you can figure out why.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this section we mentioned that <code>~/Project_0</code> represented your current directory, but now our machine is telling us that our directory is <code>/home/student/Project_0</code>.
This raises an important and very useful point.
In <code>bash</code> the <code>~</code> symbol is a shortcut for the home directory of the current user.
If Dave was logged in, this would be <code>/home/Dave</code> whilst if Anna was logged in this would be <code>/home/Anna</code>.
As we are all logged on as <code>student</code>, this now stands for <code>/home/student</code>.</p>
<p>Importantly every user with an account on a machine will have their own home directory of the format <code>/home/username1</code>, <code>/home/username2</code> etc..
Notice that they will all live in the directory <code>/home</code> which is actually the parent directory that all users will have a home directory in, as we've just tried to explain.
This can be confusing for many people, so hopefully we'll clear this up in the next section or two.</p>
<p>In the above, the <code>/home</code> directory itself began with a slash, i.e. <code>/</code>.
On a unix-based system (i.e. MacOS and Linux), the <code>/</code> directory is defined to be the root directory of the file system.
Windows users would be more familiar with seeing something similar, the <code>C:\</code> directory as the root of the main hard drive, although there are fundamental but largely uninteresting differences between these systems.
Note also that whilst Windows uses the <strong>backslash</strong> (<code>\</code>) to separate parts of a directory path, a Linux-based system uses the <strong>forward slash</strong> (<code>/</code>), or more commonly just referred to simply as &quot;slash&quot;, marking another but very important difference between the two.</p>
<h4 id="cd">cd</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>Now we know all about where we are, the next thing we need to do is go somewhere else.
The <code>bash</code> command for this is <code>cd</code> which we use to <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory.
No matter (almost) where we are in a file system, we can move up a directory in the hierarchy by using the command</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd ..
</div></code></pre>
<p>The string <code>..</code> means <em>one directory above</em> (the parent directory), whilst a single dot represents the current directory.</p>
<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>From which directory will <code>cd ..</code> not move to the parent directory?</p>
<p>Enter the above command and notice that the location immediately to the left of the $ has now changed.
Enter <code>pwd</code> again to check this makes sense to you.</p>
<p>If we now enter</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd ..
</div></code></pre>
<p>a couple more times we should be in the root directory of the file system and we will see <code>/ $</code> at the end of our prompt.
Try this and print the working directory again (<code>pwd</code>).
The output should be the root directory given as <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>We can change back to our home folder by entering one of either:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd ~
</div></code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd
</div></code></pre>
<p>The initial approach taken above to move through the directories used what we refer to as a <strong>relative path</strong>, where each move was made <em>relative to the current directory</em>.
Going up one directory will clearly depend on where we are when we execute the command.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use an <strong>absolute path</strong>.
An <strong>absolute path</strong> on Linux/Mac will always begin with the root directory symbol <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>For example, <code>/foo</code> would refer to a directory called <code>foo</code> in the root directory of the file system (NB: This directory doesn't really exist, it's an example).
In contrast, a <strong>relative path</strong> can begin with either the current directory (indicated by <code>./</code>) or a higher-level directory (indicated by <code>../</code> as mentioned above).
A subdirectory <code>foo</code> of the current directory could thus be specified as <code>./foo</code>, whilst a subdirectory of the next higher directory would be specified by <code>../foo</code>.
If the path does not have a <code>./</code> or <code>../</code> prefix, the current directory is used, so <code>foo</code> is the same as <code>./foo</code>.</p>
<p>Another common absolute path is the one mentioned right at the start of the session, specified with <code>~</code>, which stands for your home directory <code>/home/student</code>, which also starts with a <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>We can also move through multiple directories in one command by separating them with the slash <code>/</code>.
For example, we could also get to the root directory from our home directory by typing</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd ../../
</div></code></pre>
<p><strong>Return to your home directory using</strong> <code>cd</code>.</p>
<p>In the above steps, this has been exactly the same as clicking through directories in our graphical folder interface that we're all familiar with.
Now we know how to navigate folders using <code>bash</code> instead of the GUI.
This is an essential skill when logged into a High Performance Computer (HPC) or a Virtual Machine (VM) as the vast majority of these run using Linux without a graphical user interface.</p>
<h3 id="important">Important</h3>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p><em>Although we haven't directly discovered it yet, most file systems used on Unix-based systems such as Ubuntu are</em> <strong>case-sensitive</strong>, whilst <strong>Windows file systems are usually not</strong>.
For example, the command <code>PWD</code> is completely different to <code>pwd</code> and doesn't actually exist on your (or any) default installation of <code>bash</code>.
Note that while MacOS is a unix behind the scenes, it has a semi case-insensitive file system by default.
This will cause you pain if you are not aware of it.</p>
<p>If <code>PWD</code> happened to be the name of a command which has been defined in your shell, you would get completely different results than from the intended <code>pwd</code> command.
Most <code>bash</code> tools are named using all lower-case, but there are a handful of exceptions.</p>
<p>We can also change into a specific directory by giving the path to the <code>cd</code> command using text instead of dots and symbols.
Making sure you're in your home directory we can change back into the Project_0 directory</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd
cd Project_0
pwd
</div></code></pre>
<p>This is where we started the session.</p>
<h4 id="tab-auto-completion">Tab auto-completion</h4>
<p>Bash has the capacity to provide typing suggestions for command names, file paths and other parts of commands via a feature called auto-completion.
This will help you avoid a ridiculous number of typos.</p>
<p>If you start typing something bash will complete as far as it can, then will wait for you to complete the path, command or file name.
If it can complete all the way, it will.</p>
<p>Let's see this in action; change into your home folder and make two new directories.
These directories are just to demonstrate some aspects of tab auto-completion.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd
mkdir Practical_1
mkdir Practical_2
</div></code></pre>
<p>Now to change back into your Project_0 folder, type <code>cd P</code> without hitting enter.
Instead hit your <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and <code>bash</code> will complete as far as it can.
If you have setup your directories correctly, you should see this complete to <code>cd Pr</code> which is unfinished.
You also have <code>Practical_1</code> and <code>Practical_2</code> in your home folder, so <code>bash</code> has gone as far as it can.
Now it's up to us to enter the next letter <code>a</code> or <code>o</code> before hitting <kbd>Tab</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd>. If you enter <code>a</code> as the next letter <code>cd Pra</code> it will complete to <code>cd Practical_</code> which is as far as it can go.</p>
<p>When faced with multiple choices, we can also hit the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key twice and <code>bash</code> will give us all available alternatives.
Let's see this in action by changing back to our home folder.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd
</div></code></pre>
<p>Now type <code>cd Pr</code> and hit the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key twice and you will be shown all of the alternatives.
You'll still have to type the <code>o</code> though to get to <code>Project_0</code>.</p>
<p>Another example which will complete all the way for you might be to go up one from your home folder.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd
cd ..
</div></code></pre>
<p>Now to get back to your home directory (<code>/home/student</code>) start typing <code>cd s</code> followed by the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.
This should auto-complete for you and will save you making any errors.
This also makes navigating your computer system very fast once you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Importantly, if tab auto-completion doesn't appear to be working, you've probably made a typo somewhere, or are not where you think you are.
It's a good check for mistakes.</p>
<p>You can now delete empty Practical_1 and Practical_2 directories.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>rmdir ~/Practical_1
rmdir ~/Practical_2
</div></code></pre>
<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>Are the paths <code>~/Practical_1</code> and <code>~/Practical_2</code> relative or absolute paths?</p>
<h3 id="looking-at-the-contents-of-a-directory">Looking at the Contents of a Directory</h3>
<p>There is another built-in command (<code>ls</code>) that we can use to <strong>list</strong> the contents of a directory.
This is a way to get our familiar folder view in the terminal.
Making sure you are in your home directory (<code>cd ~</code>), enter the <code>ls</code> command as it is and it will print the contents of the current directory.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ls
</div></code></pre>
<p>This is the list of files that we normally see in our graphical folder view that Windows and MacOS show us by default.
We can actually check this output using <code>RStudio</code> too, so head to the <strong>Files</strong> tab in the <code>Files</code> window.
Click on the Home icon (<img src="images/home.png" alt="home">) and look at the folders and files you can see there.
<strong>Do they match the output from <code>ls</code>?</strong>
Ask for help if not.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can specify which directory we wish to view the contents of, <strong>without having to change into that directory</strong>.
Notice <strong>you can't do actually this using your classic GUI folder view</strong>.
We simply type the <code>ls</code> command, followed by a space, then the directory we wish to view the contents of.
To look at the contents of the root directory of the file system, we simply add that directory after the command <code>ls</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ls /
</div></code></pre>
<p>Here you can see a whole raft of directories which contain the vital information for the computer's operating system.
Among them should be the <code>/home</code> directory which is one level above your own home directory, and where the home directories for all users are located on a Linux system.</p>
<p>Have a look inside your Project_0 directory from somewhere else.
Tab auto-completion may help you a little.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd 
ls Project_0
</div></code></pre>
<p>Navigate into this folder using you GUI view in <code>RStudio</code> and check that everything matches.</p>
<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>Give two ways we could inspect the contents of the <code>/</code> directory from your own home directory.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-directory">Creating a New Directory</h3>
<p>Now we know how to move around and view the contents of a directory, we should learn how to create a new directory using bash instead of the GUI folder view you are used to.
Navigate to your <code>Project_0</code> folder using <code>bash</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cd ~/Project_0
</div></code></pre>
<p>Now we are in a suitable location, let's create a directory called <code>test</code>.
To do this we use the <code>mkdir</code> command as follows (you saw this above in tab auto-completion):</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>mkdir test
</div></code></pre>
<p>You should see this appear in the GUI view, and if you now enter <code>ls</code>, you should also see this directory in your output.</p>
<p>Importantly, the <code>mkdir</code> command above will only make a directory directly below the one we are currently in as we have used a relative path.
If automating this process via a script it is very important to understand the difference between <em>absolute</em> and <em>relative</em> paths, as discussed above.</p>
<h3 id="adding-options-to-commands">Adding Options To Commands</h3>
<p>So far, the commands we have used were given either without the use of any subsequent arguments, e.g. <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code>, or with a specific directory as the second argument, e.g. <code>cd ../</code> and <code>ls /</code>.
Many commands have the additional capacity to specify different options as to how they perform, and these options are often specified <em>between</em> the command name, and the file (or path) being operated on.
Options are commonly a single letter prefaced with a single dash (<code>-</code>), or a word prefaced with two dashes (<code>--</code>).
The <code>ls</code> command can be given with the option <code>-l</code> specified between the command and the directory and gives the output in what is known as <em>long listing</em> format.</p>
<p><em>Inspect the contents of your current directory using the long listing format.
Please make sure you can tell the difference between the characters <code>l</code> (lower-case letter 'l') and <code>1</code> (number one).</em></p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ls -l
</div></code></pre>
<p>The above will give one or more lines of output, and one of the first lines should be something similar to:</p>
<p><code>drwxrwxr-x 2 student student 4096 Aug 12 hh:mm test</code></p>
<p>where <code>hh:mm</code> is the time of file/directory creation.</p>
<p>The letter <code>d</code> at the beginning of the initial string of codes <code>drwxr-xr-x</code> indicates that this is a directory.
These letters are known as flags which identify key attributes about each file or directory, and beyond the first flag (<code>d</code>) they appear in strict triplets.
The first entry shows the file type and for most common files this entry will be <code>-</code>, whereas for a directory we will commonly see <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>Beyond this first position, the triplet of values <code>rwx</code> simply refer to who is able to read, write or execute the contents of the file or directory.
These three triplets refer to 1) the file's owner, 2) the group of users that the owner belongs to and 3) all users, and will only contain the values &quot;r&quot; (read), &quot;w&quot; (write), &quot;x&quot; (execute) or &quot;-&quot; (not enabled).
These are very helpful attributes for data security, protection against malicious software, and accidental file deletions.</p>
<p>The entries <code>student student</code> respectively refer to who is the owner of the directory (or file) and to which group of users the owner belongs.
Again, this information won't be particularly relevant to us today, but this type of information is used to control who can read and write to a file or directory.
Finally, the value <code>4096</code> is the size of the directory structure in bytes, whilst the date and time refer to when the directory was created.</p>
<p>Let's look in your home directory (<code>~</code>).</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ls -l ~
</div></code></pre>
<p>This directory should contain numerous folders.
There is a <code>-</code> instead of a <code>d</code> at the beginning of the initial string of flags indicates the difference between any files and directories.
On Ubuntu files and directories will also be displayed with different colours.
<strong>Can you see only folders, or do you have any files present in your home directory?</strong></p>
<p>There are many more options that we could specify to give a slightly different output from the <code>ls</code> command.
Two particularly helpful ones are the options <code>-h</code> and <code>-R</code>.
We could have specified the previous command as</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ls -l -h ~
</div></code></pre>
<p>The <code>-h</code> option will change the file size to <code>human-readable</code> format, whilst leaving the remainder of the output unchanged.
Try it and you will notice that where we initially saw <code>4096</code> bytes, the size is now given as <code>4.0K</code>, and other file sizes will also be given in Mb etc.
This can be particularly helpful for larger files, as most files in bioinformatics are very large indeed.</p>
<p>An additional option <code>-R</code> tells the <code>ls</code> command to look through each directory recursively.
If we enter</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ls -l -R ~
</div></code></pre>
<p>the output will be given in multiple sections.
The first is what we have seen previously, but following that will be the contents of each sub-directory.
It should become immediately clear that the output from setting this option can get very large and long depending on which directory you start from.
It's probably not a good idea to enter <code>ls -l -R /</code> as this will print out the entire contents of your file system.</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>ls</code> command we can also <em>glob</em> all the above options together in the command</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>ls -lhR ~
</div></code></pre>
<p>This can often save some time, but it is worth noting that not all programmers write their commands in such a way that this convention can be followed.
The built-in shell commands are usually fine with this, but many NGS data processing functions do not accept this convention.</p>
<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>The letter <code>l</code> and the number <code>1</code> are often confused in text, but have different meanings. What is the difference in behaviour of <code>ls</code> when run with the <code>-1</code> (digit) and <code>-l</code> (letter) options? How does <code>ls -1</code> differ from <code>ls</code> without options?</p>
<h4 id="how-to-not-panic">How To Not Panic</h4>

<p>It's easy for things to go wrong when working in the command-line, but if you've accidentally:</p>
<ul>
<li>set something running which you need to exit or</li>
<li>if you can't see the command prompt, or</li>
<li>if the terminal is not responsive</li>
</ul>
<p>there are some simple options for stopping a process and getting you back on track.
Some options to try are:</p>
<table>

<th style="text-align:left">Command</th>

<td style="text-align:left"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></td>

<td style="text-align:left">Suspend current job</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> is usually the first port of call when things go wrong.
However, sometimes <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> doesn't work but <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> will. If you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> you will need to terminate the process with <code>kill %1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="manuals-and-help-pages">Manuals and Help Pages</h2>
<h3 id="accessing-manuals">Accessing Manuals</h3>
<p>In order to help us find what options are able to be specified, every command available from the shell has a manual, or a help page which can take some time to get familiar with.
<em>These help pages are displayed using the pager known as</em> <code>less</code> which essentially turns the terminal window into a text viewer so we can display text in the terminal window, but with no capacity for us to edit the text, almost like primitive version of Acrobat Reader.</p>
<p>To display the help page for <code>ls</code> enter the command</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>man ls
</div></code></pre>
<p>As before, the space between the arguments is important and in the first argument we are invoking the command <code>man</code> which then looks for the <em>manual</em> associated with the command <code>ls</code>.
To navigate through the manual page, we need to know a few shortcuts which are part of the <code>less</code> pager.</p>
<p>Although we can navigate through the <code>less</code> pager using up and down arrows on our keyboards, some helpful shortcuts are:</p>
<table>

<p>Look through the manual page for the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>If we wanted to hide the group names in the long listing format, which extra options would we need set when searching our home directory?</p>
<p>We can also find out more about the <code>less</code> pager by calling it's own <code>man</code> page.
Type the command:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>man less
</div></code></pre>
<p>and the complete page will appear.
This can look a little overwhelming, so try pressing <code>h</code> which will take you to a summary of the shortcut keys within <code>less</code>.
There are a lot of them, so try out a few to jump through the file.</p>
<p>A good one to experiment with would be to search for patterns within the displayed text by prefacing the pattern with a slash (<code>/</code>).
Try searching for a common word like <em>the</em> or <em>to</em> to see how the function behaves, then try searching for something a bit more useful, like the word <em>move</em>.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-help-pages">Accessing Help Pages</h3>
<p>As well as entering the command <code>man</code> before the name of a command you need help with, you can often just enter the name of the command with the options <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> specified.
Note the convention of a single hyphen which indicates an individual letter will follow, or a double-hyphen which indicates that a word will follow.
Unfortunately the methods can vary a little from command to command, so if one method doesn't get you the manual, just try one of the others.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can take a little bit of looking to find something and it's important to be realise we won't break the computer or accidentally launch a nuclear bomb when we look around.
It's very much like picking up a piece of paper to see what's under it.
If you don't find something at first, just keep looking and you'll find it eventually.</p>
<h4 id="questions">Questions</h4>
<p>{:.no_toc}</p>
<p>Try accessing the documentation for the command <code>man</code> all the ways you can think of. Was there a difference in the output depending on how we asked to view the documentation? Could you access the documentation for the <code>ls</code> command all three ways?</p>

<p>Now we've learned about a large number of commands, let's try performing something useful.
We'll download a file from the internet, then look through the file.
<strong>In each step remember to add the filename if it's not given!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <code>cd</code> command to <strong>make sure you are in the directory</strong> <code>Project_0</code></li>
<li>Use the command <code>wget</code> to download the <code>gff</code> file <code>ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-89/gff3/drosophila_melanogaster/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.89.gff3.gz</code></li>
<li>Now unzip this file using the command <code>gunzip</code>.
(Hint: After typing <code>gunzip</code>, use tab auto-complete to add the file name.)</li>
<li>Change the name of the file to <code>dm6.gff</code> using the command <code>mv Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.89.gff3 dm6.gff</code></li>
<li>Look at the first 10 lines using the <code>head</code> command</li>
<li>Change this to the first 5 lines using <code>head -n5</code></li>
<li>Look at the end of the file using the command <code>tail</code></li>

<h1 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Regular expressions are a powerful &amp; flexible way of searching for text strings amongst a large document or file.
Most of us are familiar with searching for a word within a file, but regular expressions allow us to search for these with more flexibility, particularly in the context of genomics.
For example, we could search for a sequence that is either <code>AGT</code> or <code>ACT</code> by using the patterns  <code>A[GC]T</code> or  <code>A(G|C)T</code>.
These two patterns will search for an  <code>A</code>, followed by either a  <code>G</code> or  <code>C</code>, then followed strictly by a  <code>T</code>.
Similarly a match to <code>ANNT</code> can be found by using the patterns <code>A[AGCT][AGCT]T</code> or  <code>A[AGCT]{2}T</code>.
We'll discuss that syntax below, so don't worry if those patterns didn't make much sense.</p>
<p>Whilst the bash shell has a great capacity for searching a file to matches to regular expressions, this is where languages like <em>perl</em> and <em>python</em> offer a great degree more power.</p>
<h2 id="the-command-grep">The command <code>grep</code></h2>
<p>The built-in command which searches using regular expressions in the terminal is <code>grep</code>, which stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep"><code>g</code>lobal <code>r</code>egular <code>e</code>xpression <code>p</code>rint</a>.
This function searches a file or input on a line-by-line basis, so patterns contained within a line can be found, but patterns split across lines are more difficult to find.
This can be overcome by using regular expressions in a programming language like Python or Perl.</p>
<p>The <code>man grep</code> page (<code>grep --help | less</code> for those without <code>man</code> pages) contains more detail on regular expressions under the <code>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</code> header (scroll down a few pages).<br>
As can be seen in the <code>man</code> page, the command follows the form <code>grep [OPTIONS] 'pattern' filename</code></p>
<p>The option <code>-E</code> is preferable as it it stand for <em>Extended</em>, which we can also think of as <em>Easier</em>.
As well as the series of conventional numbers and characters that we are familiar with, we can match to characters with special meaning, as we saw above where enclosing the two letters in brackets gave the option of matching either.</p>

<h2 id="pattern-searching">Pattern Searching</h2>
<p>In this section we'll learn the basics of using the <code>grep</code> command &amp; what forms the output can take.
Firstly, we'll need to get the file that we'll search in this section.
First <strong>change into your <code>test</code> directory</strong> using the <code>cd</code> command, then enter the following, depending on your operating system:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>cp ~/data/intro_bash/words words
</div></code></pre>
<p>Now page through the first few lines of the file using <code>less</code> to get an idea about what it contains.</p>
<p>Let's try a few searches, and to get a feel for the basic syntax of the command, try to describe what you're searching for on your notes <strong>BEFORE</strong> you enter the command.
Do the results correspond with what you expected to see?</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'fr..ol'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'fr.[jsm]ol'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'fr.[^jsm]ol'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'fr..ol$'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'fr.+ol$'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'cat|dog'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'^w.+(cat|dog)'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<p>In the above, we were changing the pattern to extract different results from the files.
Now we'll try a few different options to change the output, whilst leaving the pattern unchanged.
If you're unsure about some of the options, don't forget to consult the <code>man</code> page.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -E <span class="hljs-string">'louse'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -Ew <span class="hljs-string">'louse'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -Ewn <span class="hljs-string">'louse'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -EwC2 <span class="hljs-string">'louse'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>grep -c <span class="hljs-string">'louse'</span> words
</div></code></pre>
<p>In most of the above commands we used the option <code>-E</code> to specify the extended version of <code>grep</code>.
An alternative to this is to use the command <code>egrep</code>, which is the same as <code>grep -E</code>.
Repeat a few of the above commands using <code>egrep</code> instead of <code>grep -E</code>.</p>
<p>Capturing text is something you may want to do, however these operations in <code>bash</code> are beyond the scope of this course.
To perform this we usually use the Stream EDitor <code>sed</code> and this will be covered in part 2 of this practical.
For those who are interested, there is a tutorial available at http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html.</p>
